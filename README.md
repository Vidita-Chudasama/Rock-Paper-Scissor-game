# Rock-Paper-Scissor-game in Perl

Here there are 2 files rps.pl and Executor.ipnyb...

rps.pl : contains the perl code for the rock-paper-scissor game

Executor.ipnyb : it is a colab file to execute the rps.pl

-> Perl is preinstalled in linux based systems... as the google colab already works on linux based system we can direclty run the perl script from colab file itself.

-> You just need to put these files into your drive and provide the said path of the rps.pl file in cd command in Executor.ipnyb file and run it...

-> The output would be as followed...
